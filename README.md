# Cpp-Qt

## Project Overview
Cpp-Qt is a powerful application that leverages the Qt framework for building cross-platform applications with intuitive user interfaces. It aims to provide an easy way to develop applications that can run on multiple operating systems with minimal code modifications.

## Features
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Build applications that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Rich User Interfaces**: Utilize Qt's extensive set of UI controls.
- **Multilingual Support**: Create applications that support multiple languages easily.
- **Modular Architecture**: Design applications in a modular way that enhances maintainability and scalability.

## Architecture
The architecture of Cpp-Qt follows a modular structure, promoting separation of concerns:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for the UI components and user interactions.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: Contains the core functionality and application logic.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.

Each layer communicates through well-defined interfaces, promoting loose coupling and easier unit testing.
